In this project I gathered product lists from my company and suppliers. With the goal of creating Master Sheets that have Part #'s/SKUs and UPC's that way these could be loaded into our webstores in the back end. As this would help increase our SEO rank on Google. Driving more traffic to the sites leading to more sales. A project that normally would have taken months to do, was cut down to a few days.

- CompletedLists contains all lists after the cleaning and JOINing of datasets was complete. These are the exported lists that I distributed back out to employees

SupplierLists contains the lists that come directly from the suppliers

CompanyLists contains the lists that my company provided with the parts we carry from the specific suppliers
